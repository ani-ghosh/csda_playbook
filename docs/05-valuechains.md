# Activity III: Prioritizing Value Chains

Different farming systems are affected by climate change in different and sometimes contrasting ways. Heterogeneous climate change impacts mean that, in any given location, different types of farmers may have different adaptation needs and require different types of support. There are no one-size-fits-all digital strategies that span all value chains.

CSDA solutions will vary not only in accordance with anticipated climate impacts (e.g., based on the heterogeneous climate sensitivity of different crops), but also with the predominant characteristics of the farming systems in question and their adaptive capacities (e.g., degree of commercialization, reliance on external inputs, availability of credit, etc.). Efficient resources aimed at promoting CSDA should align with programmatic development goals (by governments or donors). Policymakers and investors also need to choose which farming systems or commodities to focus their efforts on. These choices strongly influence the later prioritization of digital solutions and investment opportunities. Recognizing the importance of establishing focal priorities, this activity aims to guide the user in selecting a small group of two to three core value chains that form the basis for subsequent steps.

**Activity III Type**: Group Exercise

**Activity III Product**: Brief description of selected priority value chains, including a short rationale for their selection.

### Step 1: Consultative process to prioritize value chains{-}
Determining the priority value chains requires the consideration of multiple assessment criteria informed by available data. The process begins with the compilation of a list of ten to fifteen commodities that are known to play a significant role in the study region. This list should include value chains with major commercial importance (crops, livestock, aquaculture, and fisheries, if appropriate, and derived products traded on local and international markets) as well as major subsistence crops (cereals, roots, tubers, legumes, and bananas) and small livestock species. 

This first selection can be done in quick consultation with a few local experts—such as local senior agricultural researchers, agricultural extension managers, or staff from the local ministries of agriculture—who are able to provide a good overview of the area of interest. A couple of emails or phone calls might be enough to get the job done. The key point here is to avoid relying on a single perspective so as to avoid potential user bias in the selection of the value chains.
The next step consists of compiling secondary data supporting the development of assessment criteria for the long list of proposed value chains. The preliminary assessment criteria should comprise readily available secondary data that span the majority of the long list value chains. Some suggestions are made in Table 1 below. 
We suggest that six to eight criteria are sufficient to support the choice of priority value chains. For many indicators, it can be challenging to access reliable data. At this stage, strategic engagement with local experts and decision-makers from the agricultural sector (see above), industry representatives, and others is encouraged. A workshop session of approximately two hours with approximately five experts is suitable for building consensus at this stage. Three major aspects that should be considered include:

i.	Macro-economic relevance: In many countries, commercial agriculture is an important source of employment and government revenue (through taxes and levies). It also provides a basis for direct foreign investment. For each commodity, users should characterize the importance to the national economy of the country of interest—two core indicators are the commodity’s gross production value, and the number of citizens employed in the sector across the full value chain (including cultivation, processing, packaging, transportation, etc.).

ii.	Social relevance: In addition to supporting national economies, agriculture directly sustains large numbers of rural households across many countries. Commodities can be characterized by the total number of farmers or farming households involved in the value chain (from production to post-harvest operations and processing). This gives an idea of the share of the population that is potentially affected by the corresponding adaptation challenge and has the potential to benefit from the implemented solutions. In addition, it is useful to characterize the farmers themselves: is the commodity typically produced by the most resource-poor (e.g., sorghum), or is it likely associated with some investments and accumulation of assets (e.g., Zebu cattle, coffee)? This distinction can also help in prioritizing digital solutions presented in the later stage of this playbook. Lastly, while often an oversimplification, stereotypical distinctions between women’s crops and men’s crops may support an improved understanding of who is likely to be more strongly affected by the adaptation challenge and, likewise, whom digital solutions should target.

iii.	Climate vulnerability and exposure: As the composite hazards map from the previous activity will illustrate, not all commodities are expected to be affected by climate change to the same degree. The results from the previous exercise can be incorporated here to support further identification of the value chains with the greatest need for digital approaches to improve outcomes associated with CSA. 

**Table 1:** Assessment criteria for determining priority value chains (example commodities provided as illustration only) for which to consider CSDA implementation. For all criteria listed here, a higher number suggests a greater priority for adaptation action. A working version of this table is provided in the accompanying annex.

With the above list in hand, the next steps are to select the criteria to systematically move from the long list of value chains to a priority shortlist, and then to select the corresponding subset of commodities around which to prioritize CSDA solutions. 

### Step 2: Prioritization of value chain assessment criteria{-}
Now that multiple commodities have been identified and characterized based on several relevant assessment criteria, the next step is to determine where national priorities and digitally supported opportunities for agricultural adaptation coincide. 
The long list of commodities will generally reflect broad national or regional priorities, but individual commodities tend to address focal policy issues (e.g., climate resilience) or specific national government priorities (e.g., reaching women smallholder farmers). Depending on the specific ambitions associated with a CSDA program, this might signify a need to adjust the weighting of the corresponding relevant criteria.
In short, through expert deliberation and using the information populated in the template associated with Table 1, the users of this manual should identify two to three key criteria for prioritizing climate adaptation efforts in line with existing national development strategies. With this subset of selection criteria, the specific commodity value chains can then be readily identified.

### Step 3: Selection of focal value chains{-}
The final step in the prioritization process is to narrow down a list of ten to fifteen value chains to a smaller set of priority value chains. This choice will be based on (1) the information compiled in Table 1, and (2) the development priorities defined in the previous section. 
In this step, the previously identified group of subject matter experts with multi-disciplinary expertise are asked to evaluate, based on the compiled information, which value chains exhibit the highest adaptation needs and are simultaneously aligned with strategic priorities.

At this stage, participants should identify a medium list of approximately five priority value chains based on the corresponding assessment criteria. The participants can also decide to include other criteria (e.g., a key differentiator such as policy context) which may be useful in helping to further narrow the scope of the value chain selection in line with the agricultural and socio-economic context of the area of interest. 
Finally, participants are asked to consider which of the value chains included in the medium list can best serve as an entry point for the implementation of digitally enabled CSA solutions. These value chains will comprise the most likely subset in which the successful implementation of digital solutions will have the greatest return on investment, the greatest overall benefits, or even the greatest traction to lay the foundation for ongoing development. Again, these value chains typically receive attention from national policymakers (e.g., in relation to food security) and international donors, which makes them a logical entry point for CSDA interventions.

The expert workshop should focus on the policy convergence related to other climate adaptation activities, where there are existing investments in extension or other related areas (e.g., credit, insurance), and where there is the potential for sustained momentum associated with adaptation-related interventions more generally. Depending on the national priorities, a final selection of one to three value chains then serves as the jump-off point for the identification of potential solutions.
