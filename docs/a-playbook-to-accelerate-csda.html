<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> A Playbook to Accelerate CSDA<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>From early warning systems and seasonal agroclimatic forecasts (e.g., <a href="https://www.ignitia.se/iska">ISKA</a>) to improved access to microcredit, crop insurance (e.g., Picture-based insurance), and farm-specific agronomic advice (e.g., localized precision agriculture such as <a href="https://precisiondev.org/what-we-do/our-model/">PxD</a>), digital tools and services are rapidly making headway in agriculture throughout the developing world. Despite this proliferation, much progress is needed with regard to the actual uptake and use of these digital services by smallholder farmers. Large-scale climate adaptation will require prioritizing, selecting, and promoting a range of locally suitable solutions that address important local climate challenges. This playbook intends to help decision-makers draw a consistent “line of sight” between the climate adaptation challenge, the affected regions and value chains, and the most relevant digital solutions.</p>
<div id="need-for-a-strategic-approach-to-digital-agriculture" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Need for a strategic approach to digital agriculture<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#need-for-a-strategic-approach-to-digital-agriculture" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The shift toward CSDA requires a clear understanding of the line of sight between the adaptation challenge and the corresponding solution. Furthermore, approaches should be developed in an anticipatory manner; investments to expand the use of digital solutions to enhance CSA should be oriented not only around what problems and capabilities we have now, but in terms of what challenges we anticipate and what capabilities we will need to address those challenges in the future.
For these reasons, a structured approach is required to unpack specific (present and future) adaptation challenges. It is important to identify the context in which an investment is being made, the priority systems in which to invest, and the best options for investment—with regard to a specific solution, capacity building, or infrastructure.
An important aspect of the strategic approach is the recognition of potential complementary activities taking place within the national or regional context. To the extent that synergies can be realized, digital solutions for agriculture can become a self-reinforcing process with advances in one area enhancing advances in others. An appropriate strategy will thus carefully consider where to begin, how to position technology in relation to both the current needs and characteristics of intended beneficiaries, and identify potential obstacles and challenges as well as approaches to ensure that technology implementation is anticipatory in nature. The following sections address these elements.</p>
<div id="identifying-entry-points-for-new-digital-solutions" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Identifying entry points for new digital solutions<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#identifying-entry-points-for-new-digital-solutions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The implementation of digital solutions is often heavily supply-driven. Solutions are often developed and put forward without sufficient consideration for the users or context in which they operate. This results in solutions being developed for the sake of using new technology, rather than in a manner that sufficiently considers whether the solution is a good match for the intended beneficiaries.
For digital solutions to be effective in supporting climate adaptation, it is necessary to understand the specific adaptation challenge, potential solutions, and context in which the solutions will be implemented. A highly sophisticated solution that is only relevant to a limited number of beneficiaries will not serve to address the challenge of climate adaptation on a wide scale. Additionally, whereas a solution may be technically feasible, upstream investment (e.g., in capacity building or infrastructure) may enable a broader range of downstream opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div id="minimizing-barriers" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Minimizing barriers<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#minimizing-barriers" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The design and implementation of digital solutions for agriculture must consider the different types of barriers that could prevent successful implementation. Several key areas require examination, including the policy environment, the institutional capacity required in key domains, the availability of technological infrastructure (e.g., data processing and telecommunications resources), the capacity of beneficiaries to access and use a digital solution, and the means to incentivize its use.</p>
</div>
<div id="designing-and-implementing-context-appropriate-technology" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Designing and implementing context-appropriate technology<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#designing-and-implementing-context-appropriate-technology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The idea of minimizing barriers carries through to the design and implementation of the required digital solutions. Working to implement these solutions for agriculture in the Global South requires an understanding of the problem space (i.e., the climate impacts on agriculture systems), the institutions and individuals responsible for maintaining and providing the digital solutions, and, of course, the next users of the solutions—whether they are extension agents, agribusinesses, or farmers.
Digital solutions must align with the needs and capacities of those they are intended to serve. Depending on the region, women and men may have very different levels of access to cellphones (either feature phones or smartphones); disparate levels of general literacy, numeracy, and digital literacy; and differing abilities to objectively evaluate information and services provided by digital solutions. The effective design of CSDA solutions starts with recognizing the heterogeneity of targeted next users. Understanding the specific needs, expectations, and capacities of affected stakeholders, whether institutional or individuals, is key.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-proofing-and-anticipatory-approaches" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Future-proofing and anticipatory approaches<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#future-proofing-and-anticipatory-approaches" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Sustainable solutions also require anticipation of future needs, future capacity, and future demand. Investment in digital solutions for agriculture should be made with the recognition that, with time, not only will technology evolve, but so will the problem space and the ability of users to take advantage of the technological solutions in question.
CSDA is itself an adaptive process. Investments in new solutions should be anticipatory in the sense that investment in a capacity or a particular technology now should feed forward to solutions that meet future needs. In terms of capacity, this means investment approaches framed around “learn to learn” principles. In terms of technology solutions, this refers to technology that can adapt to the changing needs of users, e.g., a platform that can provide users with new services as they become available. Adopting a “modular and extensible” mindset in every aspect of CSDA is the basis for the strategies presented in this playbook. Finally, the playbook also examines a technological aspect of future-proofing that is often overlooked; multiple and sometimes competing solutions should use the same technology infrastructures so as to foster ongoing investment in underlying infrastructures and capacities while avoiding dependencies that result in single points of failure.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Key considerations when contemplating CSDA<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#key-considerations-when-contemplating-csda" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of developing strategy around adaptation solutions built on digital technology, four themes frame the priority space for the strategy development process. These four themes include infrastructure, capacity, governance, and priority applications. Each is addressed in turn.</p>
<div id="infrastructure" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Infrastructure<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#infrastructure" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Adaptation approaches are enabled by resilient infrastructure. In CSDA, the relevant infrastructure includes not only roads and electricity networks, but also telecommunications and information technology (IT) infrastructure. The latter is particularly important as the specific IT infrastructure required will vary depending on the solutions being implemented. This may include facilities for advanced data processing and database management, measurement stations that enable the provision of real-time information and access to satellite imagery or other sensor data processing capability, and other related support systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="capacity" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Capacity<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#capacity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Capacity in the context of the development of digital solutions for climate adaptation is an encompassing term. At one level, it refers to the capacity of institutions and individuals to design, develop, and maintain services required for the implementation of digital approaches. However, it is also essential to consider the capacity of next users to adopt and employ the innovations in their day-to-day workflows, as well as the capacity of key intermediaries to facilitate the dissemination of such services; these intermediaries include different types of agents and actors, from extension technicians to agribusiness owners.</p>

<p>Given the range of coordinated infrastructure and capacity needs, governance can either enable or impede efforts in the field of digital agricultural development. Factors such as access to credit and investment policies, literacy-related initiatives, funding of education and research, and policies affecting access to and availability of information and communications technologies can all foster positive or negative synergies around digital solutions for climate adaptation. For example, farmer registries are a key tool in bringing crucial services to farmers, but these require balanced privacy policies to recognize farmer data rights while also facilitating fair and equitable business practices.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Priorities<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#priorities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Every entity interested in considering an investment in digital approaches to support adaptation and CSA will have distinct priorities. These priorities may be driven by the predominant agricultural systems affected by climate variability in each region, the population that the investment might target and service (e.g., women farmers), or the specific climate phenomenon that presents the greatest adaptation challenge (e.g., flooding, drought, temperature extremes, locust outbreaks, etc.). Additional considerations that may influence priority setting include the recognition of barriers and opportunities specific to the factors mentioned above (i.e., capacity or infrastructure gaps may drive the selection of the most relevant digital approaches).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Importance of a participatory approach<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#importance-of-a-participatory-approach" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Any implementation of CSDA must consider actors along the entire information value chain. It is important to consider how potential options fit with current policy or, alternatively, where policy change may be needed to facilitate effective investment. Discussions around strategies for effective CSDA must include technical experts—on agriculture and climate, as well as the technology and IT sectors—as well as targeted next users. It is also critical to include members of the research community since many adaptation approaches are initially developed by researchers affiliated with universities or national and international research entities. This holistic engagement of various stakeholders, from information providers to farmers, is exemplified by the “<a href="https://ccafs.cgiar.org/resources/tools/participatory-integrated-climate-services-agriculture-picsa">PICSA</a>” approach that has been used as a starting point for bringing digital climate services to farmers in many places around the world.
Investment and innovation in the relevant technology, capacity, and infrastructure for digital solutions in agricultural adaptation thus benefit from the adoption of an integrated “triple helix” approach that facilitates interactions between research, business, and industry. Each type of entity brings a unique set of expertise. Participatory processes—whether workshops, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, or even online surveys—should work to bring these multiple viewpoints together to foster co-creation and long-term ownership of the implemented solutions. As farmers are also key stakeholders in many processes, farmer perspectives and user journeys should also be considered through structured interaction and engagement with farmers and other on-the-ground partners.</p>

<p>There are many pathways to implement CSDA. The right pathways will depend on a variety of factors, ranging from the readiness of different actors in the information value chain, to the policy environment, to the priorities among relevant business and industry partners. In some contexts, a more entrepreneurial model may drive digital development with a bottom-up and “fail forward” approach. In other contexts, efforts may follow a more directed and centralized approach, with an initial study and roadmap, corresponding policy work, and deliberate, stepwise implementation. Both approaches work and are in fact quite complementary; when combined, they result in innovation platforms such as <a href="https://www.mercycorpsagrifin.org/2019/05/27/building-the-digifarm-innovation-platform-the-journey-to-one-million-farmers/">Agrifin Digifarm</a>.</p>
<p>A complete strategy for defining investment in digital approaches to climate adaptation in agriculture will address the abovementioned steps associated with 1) characterization of the national context, 2) selection and prioritization of key value chains, 3) understanding the relevant solution spaces, 4) clarifying gaps and barriers, and 5) making recommendations. While these steps function sequentially, each one can also be conducted independently, depending on time constraints, available resources, and the requirements of those interested in making investments. In the following section, we review the overall process and discuss how any of the steps may be conducted independently or in coordination and conjunction with one or more of the others.</p>

<p>This chapter is more of a roadmap of necessary steps to implement this work, regardless of who the user is. For users of this playbook, it is important to understand that the duration of the set-up stage of a project is determined by the presence of staff and strength of networks in digital agriculture and climate adaptation in the countries under analysis.
As seen in Figure 1, there are four key steps in the project life cycle which are explained in further detail below. Two of these steps, namely desk research and the stakeholder consultative process, can be further divided into five actions. The first three actions reveal a deep understanding of adaptation needs and possibilities within a national context, and the latter two identify specific and actionable opportunities for using digital technologies in climate adaptation planning. For each action, there are different levels of how deep the assessment can go, with a light version indicating the bare minimum, and the full version including all necessary information for a deeper dive into the problem and solution spaces.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide insights that users of the playbook may wish to consider during the implementation of the processes detailed throughout.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-planning-and-staffing" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Project planning and staffing<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#project-planning-and-staffing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A successful CSDA strategy will depend on staffing a small project team and sound project planning. CSDA strategy teams should include experts on climate adaptation in agriculture, as well as experts in digital agriculture and related technologies. Ideally, at least some members of the team should be familiar with the current state of applied research and development related to CSDA, and others should have experience working in the private sector. In addition to this subject matter expertise, experience working in the selected country is very important; the inclusion and involvement of local staff will greatly benefit the project. If this combination is hard to procure in-house, hiring in-country consultants is recommended.
Team leaders require experience in project management and coordination, and need to assemble the expertise to support workshop facilitation, key informant interviews (KIIs), and consortium building. The authors of this playbook worked with teams composed of three to five subject matter experts and two to four in-country consultants. For project planning and timing, it is important to consider whether a process will include country missions or (virtual) KIIs. Planning and conducting in-country missions and workshops will take up more time than virtual meetings. The duration of this step is dependent on in-country presence, and contracting, hiring, and financial policies.</p>
</div>
<div id="desk-research-literature-review-and-stakeholder-mapping" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Desk research: Literature review and stakeholder mapping<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#desk-research-literature-review-and-stakeholder-mapping" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Once the project team and workplace are established, the next step is desk analysis to provide a high-level overview of the national context and ongoing CSDA-related activities. Though good desk research is vital for the quality of the report, the availability of relevant information can vary dramatically depending on the country in focus. Common indicators from sources like the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are not available for some countries and may be outdated for others. Similarly, the amount of documented evidence (e.g., research articles or institutional reports) on climatic challenges, technical infrastructure, and experiences with digital agriculture varies considerably across countries.
Language is another important consideration and should inform staffing as important reports may not be available in English. Understanding local languages can also facilitate stakeholder mapping. Stakeholder mapping may be developed through an analysis of publicly available documents and internet research, and by engaging in-country expertise from local staff or consultants. The duration of desk research and stakeholder mapping will depend on the experience and network of the project team (as it extends to users engaged in CSDA or related work), the availability of relevant information, and the number of countries selected.</p>
</div>
<div id="in-country-mission-workshop-and-kiis" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>In-country mission, workshop, and KIIs<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#in-country-mission-workshop-and-kiis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Desk research and stakeholder mapping set the stage for in-person workshops and targeted interviews. The conduction of at least one country mission workshop with local CSDA stakeholders is recommended to obtain a better characterization of local needs, challenges, and opportunities. KIIs can be conducted with local entrepreneurs, farmer representatives, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders, either virtually or in person. The balance across in-country missions and KIIs will determine the depth of analysis of the report, as well as the duration and budget of the project. In-country missions are expected to enhance the overall understanding and depth of the analysis. Two other benefits of organizing workshops and in-person meetings are as follows: 1) the building of a stakeholder network that can be useful in later stages, especially with regard to program implementation; and 2) bringing stakeholders in contact with each other can also benefit the stakeholder community through cross-learning and spontaneous collaboration. The choice between in-country missions and (virtual) KIIs is dependent on the budget of a project, in-country presence, and the security situation in the selected country.</p>

<h3>Final Steps: Analysis, writing, review, and dissemination<a href="a-playbook-to-accelerate-csda.html#final-steps-analysis-writing-review-and-dissemination" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The last steps include the compilation and consideration of all the results from a full analysis of the literature review, stakeholder mapping, KIIs, workshops, and/or the in-country mission in a final report. For an external review, it is important to engage reviewers with a thorough understanding of the country or region under consideration, in addition to subject matter expertise. The duration of these processes depends on the number and caliber of the writers, the desired length and depth of analysis of the report, and the time required by reviewers. When the goal is to produce these reports for public use, dissemination of the final product may include presenting the report to involved stakeholders and governments; publishing and promoting the report through well-known and accessible repositories, blogs, and social media platforms; and presenting findings during conferences or seminars and webinars.</p>

<p>The suggested Gantt chart in Figure 2 outlines the estimated number of weeks and sequence of steps taken over the course of a project. These estimates apply to a typical core team size of around four to six part-time contributors. For in-depth reports, it is strongly advisable to have an in-country mission and a one-day workshop with diverse stakeholders of current and upcoming digital agriculture initiatives. Planning for the workshop should start well in advance so stakeholders can receive an invitation at least one month before the workshop is conducted. The duration of the literature review and writing will depend on the level of in-country and subject matter expertise, the number of writers, and the hours committed to compiling the report.</p>
<p><img src="time_allocations.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Approximated time allocations for project phases and project flow for a single country analysis. The number of weeks per activity will vary depending on the institution undertaking this process due to company policy, time spent working on the project, and the number of staff—but most importantly, their prior knowledge and existing networks in the country.</p>

<p>With regard to analysis at a regional level, the project process and duration will vary depending on the number of countries included in the analysis, and whether in-country missions or KIIs are included in the process. The size of the country’s digital agriculture ecosystem and data and literature availability also affect the project duration and depth that can be achieved in the analysis. Furthermore, the time needed for the steps of the initial planning process, stakeholder mapping, and organizing the in-country mission is largely dependent on the staffing and their access to an appropriate network of stakeholders in the selected countries. Figure 3 shows the project steps with corresponding durations (expressed in weeks), the factors these durations are dependent on, the order of the steps, and whether they occur sequentially versus concurrently.</p>
