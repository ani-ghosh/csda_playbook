# List of Annex Material

The processes described in the playbook are information intensive in that are designed to bring the most current data and evidence to bear in support of improved decision making regarding appropriate investments in climate smart digital agriculture. To expedite the process and facilitate implementation in a replicable manner, we include a series of annexes that are intended to serve as support material and additional guidance in both the desktop and participatory phases of the outlined activities. The annexes are organized as follows:

**000 CSDA Master Annex - [DATE]**

This is an Excel worksheet that serves as the primary collection of annex material. The first tab in the spreadsheet (“List of Annexes”) lays out the organization of the material by Activity and provides links to the other tabs containing the corresponding information. 

The CSDA Master Annex includes support for Activity I, Activity III, and portions of Activity IV. In a handful of instances, the annex material is provided in additional files (e.g., the climate hazards dataset and code from the Adaptation Atlas used in Activity II). 

The [DATE] as indicated above corresponds to the last update to the Master Annex and will be updated as the information resources are updated or otherwise modified over time.

**200 Annex AII.1 – Hazards Data Analytics – [DATE]**

This annex is delivered in the form of a compressed “zip” file that contains a combination of both geospatial datasets and code. The primary dataset is referred to in the main text is the “Composite Hazards Dataset” which is used for the mapping and analysis mentioned in Activity II. 

Advanced users may wish to explore the code and additional datasets to generate more detailed locally specific analyses.  

**400 Annex AIV.1.3 Worksheet - Activity1**

This is a worksheet used to support of the group activities in Activity IV.

**401 Annex AIV.2 - PPPEEE Analysis Template**

This is the Excel spreadsheet used to perform the assessment of the overall readiness and relevance for implementation in the different CSDA solution spaces. 

**500 Annex AV.3 - Cost Estimation Worksheet**

This Excel spreadsheet presents a novel method based on recent literature on scaling in agriculture development. The approach presented in this spreadsheet is intended to provide a first pass estimate of the cost associated with any implementation based on several simple factors and information otherwise derived from the PPPEEE analysis.
