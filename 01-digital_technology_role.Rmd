# The Role of Digital Technology in Agricultural Adaptation in Africa

Digital technology has permeated nearly every aspect of daily life. This is true worldwide, and throughout the Global South, digital solutions are of increasing importance in everything from financial inclusion to improved decision-making associated with agricultural practices. Given the massive economic importance of agriculture throughout Africa, public initiatives and private ventures to support the use of digital tools in agricultural adaptation are emerging on what seems like a near-weekly basis. In their [2019 report](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/101498) on the digitalization of African agriculture, the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) estimated a potential total addressable market of over 2B United States dollars (USD); a simultaneous and exponential growth was also observed in terms of available technology solutions in the “Digital for Agriculture” (D4Ag) sector. 
At the same time, the CTA highlights the need for the development of clear, coordinated, and integrative agendas at both a national and regional scale. A failure to address this need would negatively impact the sustainability, efficacy, and inclusivity of implemented plans and systems. Given the pressing adaptation challenges found across the continent, the accelerated identification and implementation of digital solutions represent a triple-win scenario, with the potential to help improve food security and nutrition outcomes, increase the size and efficiency of the agricultural economy, and foster the emergence of a new technology sector that will attract young people and major investments in “agripreneurship” for many years to come.


## Key adaptation challenges in Africa

Adaptation in agriculture essentially refers to a collection of mechanisms that are largely aimed toward climate risk management. Different adaptation approaches may be required at different scales, and may refer to something as simple as the appropriate timing of planting season or as complex as an interconnected set of complementary solutions such as improved crop varieties, crop insurance, livestock insurance, access to credit, and tailored agro-advisory services all working together to help farmers minimize seasonal risk. 
A full review of adaptation challenges and their responses is beyond the scope of this playbook. There are, however, several key messages that users of this resource should consider when it comes to adaptation.

* Long-term climate change trends have resulted in increased warming at differential rates worldwide. This warming has resulted in gradual changes in precipitation regimes, seasonality, levels of solar radiation and cloudiness, and daily temperature extremes.

* Climate change has also resulted in substantial increases in climate variability: once consistent and predictable trends in temperature and rainfall are substantially less consistent in terms of timing, quantities, and extremes (although still predictable by the use of appropriate forecasts in some instances). 

* Extremes in climate variability have also resulted in an increasing frequency of hazard events including heat stress, hail, extended drought, extreme rains, and flooding. These events are spread differentially throughout the continent and may be highly localized, with negative effects such as reducing the availability of both forage and water for livestock, damaging crops during critical growing stages, or limiting access to the market. 

* Simultaneously, while climate trends are driving changes in the production of different crops, the niches for pests change too, with changing climates creating more suitable conditions for pest infestations, among other threats.

* In addition to the climate-driven challenges, unsustainable and uninformed farming decisions—such as monoculture, low-input agricultural practices, and a lack of conservation practices—further escalate the climate impacts.

* At the same time, producers in Africa are increasingly connected to the global marketplace, either directly or indirectly; they are consequently exposed to price fluctuations related to both the produce they sell, including potentially lower-priced imports, as well as the inputs they need, e.g., fertilizer, agrochemicals, and certified seeds.

* Finally, adaptation strategies should simultaneously consider how changes in livelihood strategies, including both on- and off-farm jobs in the agri-food system, may become a critical element in the changing agricultural landscape.

The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program ([AAAP](https://gca.org/programs/africa-adaptation-acceleration-program/#:~:text=The%20African%20Development%20Bank%20and,the%20impacts%20of%20Covid%2D19%2C)), developed in coordination with the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), identifies “Climate-Smart Digital Technologies” as its first pillar of action. Climate-smart digital technologies have many potential uses in addressing the abovementioned adaptation challenges, and these are briefly explored in the following section.

## Emergence of climate-smart digital agriculture (CSDA)[^1] 

Pillar 1 of the AAAP identifies the need to “scale up the availability, access, affordability, and applicability of digital and data-enabled solutions in African agriculture.” The surge in application development characterized by the CTA demonstrates a significant surge in the development of different digital solutions. In a recent policy brief in support of the Accelerating the Impact of CGIAR Climate Change Research in Africa (AICCRA) program, [Prager et al. (2022)](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/117774) demonstrated how bundling approaches that link climate information services (CIS) and climate-smart agriculture (CSA) solutions are becoming increasingly relevant and useful within the agricultural domain.
CIS, specifically seasonal forecasts tailored to support decisions made by producers, are among the early examples of digital approaches in agriculture. Basic forecasts have been available via smartphones and text messages for quite some time, and more recently, a spate of applications (see [DACA](https://www.pabra-africa.org/putting-digital-agro-climatic-services-in-the-hands-of-bean-value-chain-actors/)) and websites (see [aClimate](https://pronosticos.aclimatecolombia.org/)) have emerged that help tailor this information to specific user needs. Platforms promoting financial inclusion and improved farm management efficiency—specifically access to banking and complementary agriculture-related services (see [Lersha](https://lersha.com/))—and linking agronomic advice and agriculture insurance ([aMaizing](https://acreafrica.com/a-new-project-offers-smallholder-farmers-in-kenya-the-opportunity-to-insure-themselves-against-the-consequences-of-drought/)) are starting to become more commonplace. 
In other examples, information may be generated and tailored through digital approaches, but disseminated via other means. One example is the successful provision of climate services and other CSA advice via multimedia services such as television in Kenya ([Shamba Shape Up](https://ccafs.cgiar.org/news/these-are-some-impacts-agriculture-tv-show-can-have)), and radio in Rwanda ([CS Rwanda](https://ccafs.cgiar.org/research/projects/building-climate-services-capacity-rwanda)). 

[^1]: While we note that the climate change and agriculture development communities do not need another acronym, given the number of times that “climate-smart digital agriculture” appears in this document, we will use CSDA for purposes of brevity. 

##	Overview of challenges in CSDA

While promising, the few examples described above also highlight the substantial challenges associated with digital solutions for agriculture. First, the landscape of digital literacy is highly variable throughout Africa. The digital gender gap also remains a challenge that is deeply rooted in socio-cultural norms. Moreover, even within countries that are seen as being at the forefront of digital transformation, the reach and use of the internet may be limited or cost-prohibitive, access to smart devices is highly varied, and there may also be questions about the trustworthiness and quality of the information and services provided by digital means. 
Connecting CSA with digital solutions for agriculture requires addressing a range of issues simultaneously. At the outset, the capacity of national partners to understand information needs, generate relevant information, and provide it to the next users in an understandable form is critical. Depending on specific adaptation needs (influenced by specific climate hazards, as well as the demographics of those affected, among other factors), this may be a relatively simple or potentially more sophisticated endeavor. Likewise, it is important to understand the capacity of the next users and how they might successfully engage with digital approaches (e.g., directly, through an intermediary, or via a message or an app, etc.). Equally important is the technical infrastructure. Considerations here relate to the general electricity and telecommunications infrastructure, and the technical infrastructure required by national partners (e.g., the meteorological service, insurance providers, universities and other research organizations, etc.) to generate, translate, and distribute the information component at the core of many digital solutions. 
Finally, any endeavor must also look at the policy landscape. The policy perspective must consider both macro drivers (e.g., the national ease of doing business, infrastructure plans and conditions, educational institutions, etc.) as well as more direct drivers (i.e., how digital solutions factor into national adaptation planning processes, priority value chains, etc.). 

## Purpose of the playbook

It should be clear by now that CSDA is a promising component, as well as an enabler, of the overall set of climate adaptation solutions. It should also be clear that, for digital solutions to be effective and sustainable, they should be implemented in a manner that is simultaneously rigorous and systematic while also encouraging ongoing innovation. No single innovator or government agency is capable of “owning” the entire process. For these reasons, a comprehensive and consultative process is required to identify the areas of greatest need, explore potential priority opportunities, and ensure that the solutions developed are relevant, sustainable, and consistent with best practices. 
Along with a variety of different examples, this manual provides guidance to support this process from end to end. From understanding the national context and adaptation priorities, to identifying priority value chains and viable solutions, this playbook facilitates a replicable, systematic process for strategy development and the identification of best-bet digital solutions for CSA. This resource will help adaptation practitioners bridge the gap between the adaptation challenge and the adaptation solution, and support the design of key interventions along with the approaches needed to ensure quality products and their adoption. 
The next sections lay out the use of the playbook in greater depth and offer a series of steps for deriving actionable information to be used on the path toward improved digitally-based agricultural adaptation outcomes.
